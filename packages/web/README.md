# @apollo/web

Web frontend for Project Apollo.

## Stack (Decided)

- **React** with **Vite**
- TypeScript
- Depends on `@apollo/core` for shared types

## Status

Placeholder — will scaffold after core types and logic are implemented.

## Future Considerations

- Graph visualization library (e.g., React Flow, D3)
- State management (React Context, Zustand, or similar)
- UI component library (TBD)
