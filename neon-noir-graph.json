    "enrichmentSummary": "This package steers the narrative toward a principled noir about competing systems of loyalty: Cain’s personal code versus the hollow legitimacy of corrupt institutions. By anchoring the Theme Stated before Rigo seeks him out, the story’s direction becomes less about returning to crime and more about whether any code can survive when authority itself is just another crew with masks.",
