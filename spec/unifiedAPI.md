Generation System Specification
Specialized Endpoints with Expansion Scope

1. Overview
This specification defines a generation system with four specialized endpoints, each focused on a primary output type but capable of producing related content based on an "expansion scope" parameter. This replaces the previous generic "entry point" approach with a more structured, predictable generation model.
Design Principles

Primary Focus: Each endpoint has a clear primary output type
Controlled Expansion: The expansionScope parameter determines whether related nodes are generated
Universal Suggestions: All endpoints can produce Story Context additions and stashed ideas
Dependency Ordering: Scenes require committed story beats; the API enforces this

The Four Modes
ModeEndpointPrimary OutputPurposeStory Beats/propose/story-beatsStoryBeat nodesFill in narrative structureCharacters/propose/charactersCharacter nodesDevelop the castScenes/propose/scenesScene nodesCreate scenes for story beatsExpand/propose/expandVaries by targetDevelop any existing node

2. Common Schemas
2.1 Expansion Scope
All endpoints accept this parameter:
typescripttype ExpansionScope = 'constrained' | 'flexible';

// 'constrained': 
//   - Generate only the primary output type
//   - Reference existing nodes but don't create new supporting nodes
//   - Still may produce suggestions (context additions, stashed ideas)

// 'flexible':
//   - Generate primary output plus supporting nodes
//   - May create new characters, locations, objects as needed
//   - More creative, more interconnected output
2.2 Package Structure
All endpoints return packages with this structure:
typescriptinterface NarrativePackage {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  summary: string;
  
  // Primary output - always present, type depends on endpoint
  primary: {
    type: 'StoryBeat' | 'Character' | 'Scene' | 'Mixed';
    nodes: Node[];
    edges: Edge[];
  };
  
  // Supporting nodes - only present when expansionScope: 'flexible'
  supporting?: {
    characters?: CharacterNode[];
    locations?: LocationNode[];
    objects?: ObjectNode[];
    storyBeats?: StoryBeatNode[];  // For character mode hints
    edges: Edge[];  // Edges connecting supporting nodes
  };
  
  // Suggestions - may be present regardless of expansionScope
  suggestions?: {
    contextAdditions?: ContextAddition[];
    stashedIdeas?: StashedIdea[];
  };
}

interface ContextAddition {
  id: string;
  section: 'themes' | 'conflicts' | 'motifs' | 'tone' | 'constraints';
  content: string;
  action: 'append';  // For now, only append; could add 'replace' later
}

interface StashedIdea {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  category: 'character' | 'plot' | 'scene' | 'worldbuilding' | 'general';
  relatedNodeIds?: string[];  // Optional references to existing nodes
}
2.3 Common Request Parameters
typescriptinterface CommonGenerationParams {
  expansionScope?: ExpansionScope;  // default: 'flexible'
  direction?: string;               // User guidance/instructions
  packageCount?: number;            // default: 3, max: 10
  creativity?: number;              // 0-1, default: 0.5
}
```

## 3. Story Beats Endpoint

### 3.1 Purpose

Generate StoryBeat nodes that align to Save the Cat structural beats. Used for filling in the narrative structure before developing scenes.

### 3.2 Endpoint
```
POST /stories/:storyId/propose/story-beats
3.3 Request Schema
typescriptinterface ProposeStoryBeatsRequest extends CommonGenerationParams {
  // Focus options (all optional, use to narrow generation)
  priorityBeats?: string[];         // Beat IDs or BeatTypes to prioritize
                                    // e.g., ["Catalyst", "Midpoint"] or ["beat_Catalyst"]
  targetAct?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;    // Focus on specific act
  
  // Output limits
  maxStoryBeatsPerPackage?: number; // default: 5, max: 10
}
3.4 Response Schema
typescriptinterface ProposeStoryBeatsResponse {
  sessionId: string;
  packages: NarrativePackage[];
  
  // Metadata about structural gaps
  missingBeats: MissingBeatInfo[];
}

interface MissingBeatInfo {
  beatId: string;
  beatType: BeatType;  // e.g., "Catalyst", "Midpoint"
  act: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
  position: number;
  hasStoryBeat: boolean;  // false if no StoryBeat aligned
}
3.5 Primary Output

Node type: StoryBeat
Required edges: ALIGNS_WITH (StoryBeat → Beat)
Optional edges: PRECEDES (StoryBeat → StoryBeat)

3.6 Supporting Output (when flexible)
Node TypeWhen GeneratedCharacterWhen story beat introduces a new character conceptLocationWhen story beat specifies a setting
Supporting edges:

No direct edges from StoryBeat to Character/Location (those come via Scenes later)
Characters and Locations are "introduced by" the package but not formally linked

5.3 Request Schema
typescriptinterface ProposeScenesRequest extends CommonGenerationParams {
  // Required: which story beats to develop scenes for
  storyBeatIds: string[];           // Must be committed StoryBeat IDs
  
  // Output options

  storyBeatId: string;
  title: string;
  alignedTo: string;  // Beat type, e.g., "Catalyst"
}

interface RejectedBeatInfo {
  storyBeatId: string;
  reason: 'not_found' | 'not_committed' | 'already_has_scenes';
}
5.5 Primary Output

Node type: Scene
Required edges:

SATISFIED_BY (StoryBeat → Scene) - links scene to its story beat
HAS_CHARACTER (Scene → Character) - at least one character
LOCATED_AT (Scene → Location) - scene location



5.6 Supporting Output (when flexible)
Node TypeWhen GeneratedCharacterWhen scene introduces a new characterLocationWhen scene requires a new settingObjectWhen scene features a significant prop
5.7 Constraint: Committed Story Beats Only
The endpoint MUST validate that all requested storyBeatIds:

Exist in the graph
Are in COMMITTED status (not proposed)

If any story beat is not committed, it should be returned in rejectedBeats with reason 'not_committed'.

Flexible output (adds):

Scenes that could be set here
Objects present in location
Characters associated with location

When target is Story Context:
Constrained output:

Additional themes, conflicts, motifs
Refined tone description
New constraints/guidelines

Flexible output (adds):

Character concepts that embody themes
StoryBeat hints that could explore conflicts
Stashed ideas for development

## 7. Shared Behaviors

### 7.1 Session Management

All endpoints create a proposal session that can be managed with existing endpoints:

- **View active proposal**: `GET /stories/:id/propose/active`
- **Commit a package**: `POST /stories/:id/propose/commit`
- **Discard session**: `DELETE /stories/:id/propose/active`

### 7.2 Package Operations

Before committing, users can modify packages:

- **Edit node**: Modify any node's fields within the package
- **Remove node**: Mark a node for exclusion from commit
- **Remove suggestion**: Dismiss a context addition or stashed idea

### 7.3 Suggestion Handling

Context additions and stashed ideas are handled specially:

**Context Additions:**
- When package is committed, context additions are appended to Story Context
- Each addition goes to its specified section
- User can dismiss individual additions before commit

**Stashed Ideas:**
- When package is committed, stashed ideas go to an Ideas collection
- Ideas are stored separately from the main graph
- Users can later promote ideas to real nodes or delete them

### 7.4 Validation

All endpoints validate:

1. Story exists and is accessible
2. Referenced node IDs exist (for expand, scenes)
3. Committed status where required (scenes endpoint)
4. Node types match expected types

8.4 Context-Aware Generation
When user has selected a node in the Story Bible:

Generation Panel detects selection
Expand mode auto-selects with that node as target
Shows: "Expand: [Node Name]"
User can override or proceed

When user clicks empty beat in Structure:

Generation Panel could auto-switch to Story Beats mode
Pre-select that beat as priority
Or show inline "Generate story beat" button on the empty beat card


9. Ideas/Stash Feature
9.1 Data Model
typescriptinterface StashedIdea {
  id: string;
  storyId: string;
  content: string;
  category: 'character' | 'plot' | 'scene' | 'worldbuilding' | 'general';
  relatedNodeIds?: string[];
  sourcePackageId?: string;  // Which package created this
  createdAt: string;
  status: 'active' | 'promoted' | 'dismissed';
}
```

### 9.2 API Endpoints
```
GET /stories/:id/ideas              // List all stashed ideas
POST /stories/:id/ideas             // Manually create an idea
PATCH /stories/:id/ideas/:ideaId    // Update idea status
DELETE /stories/:id/ideas/:ideaId   // Remove idea
```

### 9.3 UI Location

In the Story Bible left nav:
```
STORY BIBLE
├── Premise ✓
├── Elements
├── Structure
│   ├── Act 1
│   └── ...
├── Context
└── Ideas (3)        ← Stashed ideas bucket

10. Migration Path
Phase 1: Story Beats Endpoint (Already Exists)

Endpoint: /propose/story-beats ✓
Add expansionScope parameter
Add supporting nodes output
Add suggestions output

Phase 2: Characters Endpoint

New endpoint: /propose/characters
Implement all focus types
Add arc generation

Phase 3: Scenes Endpoint

New endpoint: /propose/scenes
Implement committed-only validation
Add supporting elements

Phase 4: Expand Endpoint

New endpoint: /propose/expand
Implement all target types
Story Context expansion

Phase 5: UI Integration

Update Generation Panel with mode selector
Add mode-specific options
Update package review UI
Implement Ideas section

Phase 6: Deprecation

Mark generic /propose as deprecated
Remove "Auto (AI decides)" from UI
Eventually remove generic endpoint


11. Open Questions for Implementation

Hint vs. Real Node: When Characters mode produces story beat "hints," should these be actual StoryBeat nodes marked as suggestions, or a separate lighter-weight data structure?
Stashed Ideas Storage: Should ideas be stored in the graph as a special node type, or in a separate collection?
Context Additions Format: Should context additions be stored as pending operations until commit, or immediately previewed in the Story Context UI?
Selection Sync: How does node selection in Story Bible communicate with the Generation Panel? Event bus? Shared state?
Scenes Endpoint - Multiple Beats: If user selects multiple story beats, should scenes be grouped by beat in the package, or mixed?
